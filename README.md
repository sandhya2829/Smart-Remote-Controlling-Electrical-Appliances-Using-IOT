##  Getting Started

### ðŸ”§ Steps:

1. Connect relay module to NodeMCU as:
   - IN1 to D1  
   - IN2 to D2  
   - IN3 to D3  
   - IN4 to D4  
   - GND to GND  
   - VCC to 3V

2. Connect appliance terminals to Relay Common & NO.

3. Upload the code to NodeMCU using Arduino IDE.

4. Use a web/mobile interface  to control each relay.
